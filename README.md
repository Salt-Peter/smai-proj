## Goal
The main aim is to predict whether a user session will lead to a purchase being made.


## Problem definition
#### What is the problem?  
Given a collection of sequences of click events; click sessions. 
For some of the sessions, there are also buying events.
The goal is hence to predict whether the user (a session) is going to buy something or not,
and if he is buying, what would be the items he is going to buy.

#### How things will be done ?  
This will be done by training models on click data set and purchase data sets.


## Results of the project
#### What will be done?  
Given a sequence of click events performed by some user during a typical session in an e-commerce website,
the goal is to predict whether the user is going to buy something or not, and if he is buying, what would be
the items he is going to buy.  


#### What is the expected final result?
- A model which predict whether a given user session will lead to a purchase being made(Yes|No)
- If yes, what are the items that are going to be bought?
